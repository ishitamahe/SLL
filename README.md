# SLL
## Aim
To perform operations on a Singly Linked List.
## Theory
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. It is a sequence of links which contains items. The simplest kind of linked list is a singly liked list (SLL) which has one link per node. It has two parts, one part contains data and other contains address of next node. They also let you insert elements at the beginning and end of the list. We also use a function called malloc(). malloc() is a standard library function in C that allocates memory of size equal to the size of newnode structure in the heap region during runtime and returns a void pointer to that location.
## Conclusion
In this practical, we learnt the concept of simply linked list. We used different functions to implement different operations like input at beginning, input atend, delete from beginning, delete from end and searching of elements.
